# Local installation

Be sure to have installed :
- python3
- `apt install python3-pip`
- `apt -y install graphviz`
- `pip install numpy`
- Be sure to have a JAVA_HOME initialized in your profile, .bahsrc for example.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` in dialog-manager/core/src/main/resources/python/install

## Careful with rights
- be sure to have jep in your path
- launch : `wich jep` to find were it is installed
- launch `jep` to see if your user has the rights to launch it
- Jep must have the same rights as the JAVA_HOME, so it must be available to your user.
